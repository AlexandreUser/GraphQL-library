# GraphQL library

GraphQL is a query language created based in graphs theory.
## pros:
  - Easy to create
  - Easy to query the data you need
  - Flexibility


#### My  overview
> I believe graphQL can be very useful for creating search engines
> The Cache is stored, so if the data is searched again, it will be really fast
> It's the easiest way to deploy your dataset
